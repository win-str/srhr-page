    <!-- Consent Module -->
    <div class="srhr-module" id="consentSection">
      <h2>Understanding Consent</h2>
      
      <p>Consent is the foundation of healthy relationships and interactions. It means giving or receiving permission for something to happen through clear communication and mutual agreement.</p>
      
      <div class="key-concept">
        <h3>The FRIES Model of Consent</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Freely given</strong> - Consent is given voluntarily without pressure, manipulation, or under the influence of substances.</li>
          <li><strong>Reversible</strong> - Anyone can change their mind at any time, even if they've previously said yes.</li>
          <li><strong>Informed</strong> - All parties understand what they're agreeing to.</li>
          <li><strong>Enthusiastic</strong> - All participants should be excited and genuinely interested, not just going along with it.</li>
          <li><strong>Specific</strong> - Saying yes to one activity doesn't mean consent for other activities.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <h3>What Consent Is:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>An ongoing process that requires clear communication</li>
        <li>Required for all intimate activities, not just sex</li>
        <li>Something that can be withdrawn at any time</li>
        <li>Best when it's verbal, though nonverbal cues can support verbal consent</li>
        <li>A mutual agreement between people who have the capacity to consent</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What Consent Is Not:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Assumed or implied based on clothing, past behavior, or relationship status</li>
        <li>Silent or passive participation</li>
        <li>Coerced through pressure, guilt, or threats</li>
        <li>Possible when someone is incapacitated by alcohol, drugs, or sleep</li>
        <li>A one-time discussion - it needs to be ongoing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="myth-fact">
        <div class="myth">
          <div class="myth-title">MYTH</div>
          <p>If someone doesn't say "no" clearly, they're giving consent.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
          <div class="fact-title">FACT</div>
          <p>The absence of "no" is not consent. Look for an enthusiastic, clear "yes" instead.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Age of Consent</h3>
      <p>The age of consent is the age at which a person is legally considered able to agree to sexual activity. This varies by country and region (typically between 16-18 years old). People below the age of consent cannot legally give consent, even if they verbally agree.</p>
      
      <h3>Practicing Consent Communication</h3>
      <p>Here are some examples of asking for consent:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Would you like to...?"</li>
        <li>"Can I...?"</li>
        <li>"Is this okay?"</li>
        <li>"How does this feel?"</li>
        <li>"Do you want to continue?"</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Remember that consent is about respect, communication, and ensuring everyone feels safe and comfortable.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Contraception Module -->
    <div class="srhr-module" id="contraceptionSection">
      <h2>Contraception Methods</h2>
      
      <p>Contraception allows individuals and couples to prevent pregnancy and plan if and when to have children. There are many different methods available, each with its own advantages, effectiveness rates, and considerations.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Use Contraception?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>To prevent unintended pregnancies</li>
        <li>To space pregnancies for health reasons</li>
        <li>To allow for life planning and educational/career goals</li>
        <li>Some methods also provide protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</li>

    <!-- Reproductive Rights Module -->
    <div class="srhr-module" id="rightsSection">
      <h2>Reproductive Rights</h2>
      
      <p>Reproductive rights are the rights of individuals to make autonomous decisions about their reproductive health, including whether and when to have children. These rights form an essential component of human rights and are recognized internationally.</p>
      
      <h3>Core Reproductive Rights</h3>
      <p>Reproductive rights include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The right to make reproductive decisions free from discrimination, coercion, and violence</li>
        <li>The right to access sexual and reproductive health information and education</li>
        <li>The right to access reproductive healthcare services</li>
        <li>The right to bodily autonomy and integrity</li>
        <li>The right to decide freely on the number and spacing of children</li>
        <li>The right to privacy in making reproductive decisions</li>
        <li>The right to equality and non-discrimination in all matters related to reproduction</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="key-concept">
        <h3>International Frameworks</h3>
        <p>Several international agreements support reproductive rights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW, 1979)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD, 1994)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2015)</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Access to Services</h3>
      <p>Reproductive rights encompass access to essential services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Family planning services:</strong> Access to contraception and fertility services</li>
        <li><strong>Safe abortion care:</strong> Where legal, access to safe abortion and post-abortion care</li>

        <li><strong>STI prevention and treatment:</strong> Including HIV/AIDS services</li>
        <li><strong>Fertility treatments:</strong> For those experiencing difficulties conceiving</li>
        <li><strong>Sexual education:</strong> Age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Reproductive Justice</h3>
      <p>The reproductive justice framework goes beyond individual rights to address systemic inequalities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The right to have children</li>
        <li>The right not to have children</li>
        <li>The right to parent children in safe and healthy environments</li>
        <li>The right to bodily autonomy free from any form of reproductive oppression</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This framework recognizes that reproductive decisions are influenced by social, economic, and environmental factors like poverty, racism, and lack of healthcare access.</p>
      
      <div class="myth-fact">
        <div class="myth">
          <div class="myth-title">MYTH</div>
          <p>Reproductive rights only concern women.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
          <div class="fact-title">FACT</div>
          <p>Reproductive rights impact everyone regardless of gender. All people should have access to information and services to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Barriers to Reproductive Rights</h3>
      <p>Many barriers continue to limit access to reproductive rights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Legal restrictions and criminalization</li>
        <li>Limited availability of services, especially in rural areas</li>
        <li>High costs and lack of insurance coverage</li>
        <li>Cultural or religious stigma</li>
        <li>Misinformation and lack of education</li>
        <li>Discrimination against marginalized groups</li>
        <li>Coercive practices like forced sterilization</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Advocacy for Reproductive Rights</h3>
      <p>Supporting reproductive rights can take many forms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Staying informed about reproductive rights issues</li>
        <li>Voting for policies and representatives who support reproductive rights</li>
